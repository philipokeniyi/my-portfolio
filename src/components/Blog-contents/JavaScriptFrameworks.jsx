        <p className="blog-contents-introduction">
          JavaScript frameworks have transformed web development, making it
          easier to build dynamic and interactive applications. Among the most
          popular frameworks today are React, Vue, and Angular. Each of these
          frameworks offers unique features, strengths, and use cases. This
          guide explores their differences, advantages, and when to use each.

          <h3 className="blog-contents-sub-title">React: The UI Powerhouse</h3>
          <p>
            React, developed by Facebook, is a library (not technically a
            framework) for building user interfaces. It is component-based,
            allowing developers to create reusable UI components. React follows
            a declarative programming approach, making it easier to understand
            and debug.

          <p className="blog-contents-section-p-sub">Key Features</p>
          <ul className="blog-contents-list">
            <li>
              Virtual DOM: React optimizes UI rendering with a virtual DOM,
              reducing performance bottlenecks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Component-Based Architecture: Modular and reusable components
              enhance maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              React Hooks: Hooks simplify state and lifecycle management in
              functional components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strong Community Support: Extensive documentation and third-party
              libraries make development efficient.
